### What and why

This style guide was created to maintain a consistent look and feel across all of our applications.  The documentation will help aid in getting our systems up to date and consistent.

### Browser support

Primer currently supports Internet Explorer 9+ and the latest two versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on OS X and Windows. While not specifically supported it does function on older versions of IE (barely).

### Dependencies

- Our styles are built with SCSS.
- Bower is used to install/maintain 3rd party components such as bootstrap-sass and javascript libraries.
- A custom plugin for snippet and example combos, `example.rb`, was created as a fork of Jekyll's built-in `highlight` plugin.
